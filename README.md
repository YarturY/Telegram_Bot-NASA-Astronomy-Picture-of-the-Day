# Telegram_Bot-NASA-Astronomy-Picture-of-the-Day

In this repository, you can find Java code with which a request to the NASA website is integrated, and with the help of a telegram bot, you can view a picture of the day or a picture of the day for any date.
Unfortunately, the bot only works when I run a Java project, if I wanted to make it offline, I would have to pay for the cloud.ðŸ™ƒ
